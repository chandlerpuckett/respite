A virtual art-crawl

# Summary of Idea

We’re creating a Virtual Museum Experience for the user, an app that’s aesthetically pleasing and a welcome break from the stresses of daily life. The app will pull fine art exhibits from an art museum API (Artsy/Rijk/Unsplash to be decided) to display to the user. They will be able to swipe through paintings, photographs, and sculptures as if they were visiting the museum in person; a virtual walkthrough if you will. 
- The user will be presented with a color palette based on the images provided by the API, the color palette will be applied to the user’s “gallery”
- As a stretch goal the “gallery” will also play music for a complete audio/visual experience

# What problem does it solve?

Since we’re all stuck at home it provides a virtual escape from the mundane, and allows art enthusiasts, creatives, or anyone who just needs a break, to browse a virtual gallery of fine art exhibits from around the world. It is a welcome break from the doom-scrolling that can be found on typical social media apps. 

# MVP - Minimum Viable Product

- Site provides user with two color palette display options
- Site pulls images from art API to display to user
- Stores favorites images / palettes into database
